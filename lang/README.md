# Translations
In case you try to make a translation, here are some hints:

`Comprehend Languages` and `Tongues` should not be translated directly. They are named after the D&D spells and their names differs from language to language.

`POLYGLOT.Translation` is meant to appear when the character understands the language but don't know what it is (i.e. under the effects of a spell that let's them understand it).

`POLYGLOT.ToggleRunes` is meant to appear on the header of a Journal window.

# System Specific Translations
`POLYGLOT.COC7.LanguageOwn`, `POLYGLOT.COC7.LanguageAny`, `POLYGLOT.COC7.LanguageOther` and `POLYGLOT.COC7.LanguageSpec` should use their equivalents on your language's Babele translation.

`POLYGLOT.SWADE.LanguageSkills`, `POLYGLOT.WFRP4E.LanguageSkills` need to use the name used on their actual translations, otherwise it won't work. For example, COC7's Portuguese translation uses `Outros LÃ­nguas`, while WFRP4E's French translation uses `Langue`.
